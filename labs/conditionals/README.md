# Assignment 5 - Conditionals and Decision Trees

## Step 1 - Copy files from my Github

Copy the files from https://github.com/kevtr0n-marist/cmpt-120/tree/main/labs/conditionals to a new folder in your project called `conditionals` in your `labs` folder.

## Step 2 - Write the functions

First write a new function inside your `conditionals.py` file called `is_equilateral`. This function has 3 parameters; `x`, `y`, and `z`. The goal of this function is to check and see if the 3 lengths of a triangle are the same.
